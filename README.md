# ECE-6110-Function-Gen
 
 ECE 6110 - Quiz 2 - Tyler McCormick

 This code implements a function generator, where a user can choose from a sine, sawtooth, or square wave. The amplitude of all
 three functions is adjustable from 1-9, and the frequency is as well. For a square wave, the duty cycle can also be chosen.

 All choices are entered via a UART connection, such as Hyperterminal or PUTTY. The output can be viewed via selecting the variable
 "signalOutput" in STM32CubeMonitor.
